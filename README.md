This tool was created to hash all the pieces of your torrent download and match against the piece hash found inside the provided torrent metafile. The result is either that all the pieces passed the hash checking, or that the last piece failed the checking, in which case the application does not go on checking the other pieces. The application will only work with a torrent metafile, it will not automatically retrieve it from a magnet URI, sorry for that. The application was built with .NET Core so it is cross platform.
